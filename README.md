## Hobby Final Project — CMSC 22

Good day! 

This is a repacked board game called World at War(Blitz!) which takes inspiration from my favorite childhood
board game which is Salpakan or GotG.

The game utilizes all the first three row spaces which leads to more dynamic action all throughout a game instance.

It features:
- One extra 5-Star General
- Two extra Agents(Spies)
- Three extra Privates

I do not claim ownership for the entire code as I have spent a lot of time in resourcing and converting codes from old
modules, implementing them and improving their usage. 

The project is nowhere near being fully optimized and there are some features I have not found ways to implement yet.
